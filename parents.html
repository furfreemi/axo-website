      <h1>Information for Parents</h1>

      <p>
        We've all heard the stereotypes surrounding sorority life. At Case, however, Greek Life tends to defy those stereotypes, and Alpha Chi works to
        positively influence people's opinions of sororities and what they stand for.
        As a sister of Alpha Chi Omega, your daughter becomes a member of a national organization with countless lifelong benefits. A few reasons why
        joining Alpha Chi is such a rewarding experience:
      </p>

      <h2>Scholarship</h2>
      <p>
        Greek organizations were founded on the principles of successful scholarship. Alpha Chi Omega is committed to the academic progress and achievement of
        all its members. We provide academic opportunities through study hours, mentoring, recognition for achievement, and overall focus on academic success.
        Many sisters find that their GPA actually rises after joining our organization.
      </p>

      <h2>Sisterhood</h2>
      <p>
        Forming lasting friendships is an integral part of your daughter's college experience. As a member, she will be able to bond with more than ninety other
        women who have a variety of interests and are involved in numerous activities on campus. Alpha Chi encourages its members to be themselves and feels that
        each woman can contribute something different to our sorority. We have no housing requirement for new members, but every sister has 24/7 access to the
        house and will always be welcome to study, find support, or simply hang out at the house.
      </p>

      <h2>Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from the social aspects of the sorority, membership in Alpha Chi Omega offers women a variety of opportunities to become involved in numerous
        activities on campus. Our organization is student-led, with our executive board being elected each year, and even more positions supporting that board.
        There's always leadership opportunities in our chapter for those looking to step up. Many sisters also hold leadership positions in a wide variety of
        campus clubs and organizations, providing opportunities and support for other sisters looking to get involved.
      </p>

      <h2>Service</h2>
      <p>
        Alpha Chi Omega supports the continuing fight against domestic violence by holding fundraisers and awareness events throughout the year to raise
        money to support this cause. We want to work for the betterment of the Cleveland community, so most of our service and fundraising efforts are dedicated
        to the Domestic Violence and Child Advocacy Center (DVCAC) of Cleveland. Sisters also volunteer throughout the community, from the Rainbow Babies
        childrens' hospital to the Nature Center in Shaker Heights.
      </p>

      <h2>Anti-Hazing</h2>
      <p>
        During your daughter's membership, she will not be asked to do anything that will harm her physically, mentally, or emotionally. This is Alpha
        Chi's promise to you and your daughter. Hazing is considered a form of domestic violence, and goes against the very ideals that our organization
        was founded on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alpha Chi strives to fulfill the true spirit of sisterhood, and encourage its members to develop, through personal effort, a high moral
        and mental standard. As beneficiaries of the heritage and history of the sorority, we expect each member to be both true to and worthy of
        the legacy and principles of Alpha Chi.
      </p>
      <p>
        By becoming a sister, a woman voluntarily pledges to reflect the values and standards of our sorority. This means that, once initiated,
        she must uphold the five membership criteria upon which her membership is based: Academic Interest, Character, Financial Responsibility,
        Leadership Ability, and Personal Development. Each woman is expected to positively represent the sorority by respecting herself and others.
      </p>
