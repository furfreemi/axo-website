      <h1>Philanthropy</h1>
      <p>
        Alpha Chi Omega adopted the Support of Victims of Domestic Violence as a national altruistic project in 1992. Within the
        Cleveland community, our sisters work to support the Domestic Violence and Child Advocacy Center of Cleveland (DVCAC) through
        our annual Domestic Violence Awareness Week and Walk a Mile events on Case's campus. Sisters are also expected to be involved
        within the community and complete service hours each semester.
      </p>

      <h2>Domestic Violence Awareness Week</h2>
      <p>
        Held every Fall semester, DVA Week serves to engage our campus in raising awareness of domestic violence and raising funds in
        support of those working to stop it. Our events throughout the week usually include:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Purple Day:</b>
        Students across campus, from both the Greek and non-Greek community, wear purple alongside our sisters in honor of Domestic Violence
        Awareness. Sisters hand out purple ribbons to raise further awareness of this cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Hidden Voices:</b>
        Domestic violence is a difficult issue to discuss, especially as it impacts so many of us or those close to us. To raise awareness
        of how close domestic violence is to all of us, a vigil is held on each side of campus, featuring real stories of violence. This serves
        as an opportunity for community members to learn about and reflect on the impact domestic violence has on our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Domestic Violence Presentation:</b>
        A speaker is welcomed to our campus, and talks about a variety of topics relating to domestic violence. Discussions are held on
        how Case students can make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Voices Against Violence:</b>
        Sisters team up with Sexual Assault and Violence Educators (SAVE) to host an event allowing survivors and others to share their
        stories and experiences, and to speak out against domestic violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Bake Sale:</b>
        Sisters make baked goods that are sold in Nord and on the quad, with all proceeds benefiting the DVCAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>GI Alpha Chi:</b>
        The final event of the week, fraternities, sororities, other campus organizations, and groups of friends make teams to compete in
        an obstacle course race helping to raise money for the DVCAC.
      </p>

      <h2> Walk a Mile in Her Shoes</h2>
      <p>
        Every Spring, we host a modified <a href="http://www.walkamileinhershoes.org" target="_blank">Walk a Mile in Her Shoes</a>.
        The all-day event invites any and all members of the Case campus to form relay teams or come and join sisters for barbecue and music.
        Relay participants put on a provided pair of heels (guys included) and proceed to race around a course, competing head-to-head against
        other teams. Winners are recognized with a decorated heel trophy. All donations from team registrations go directly to the DVCAC.

      <h1>Service</h1>
      <p>
        Every semester, each sister completes a minimum ten hours of service, and many choose to go above and beyond. We organize chapter-wide
        volunteer opportunities, host service mixers with other Greek organizations, and volunteer individually or in smaller groups at sites of
        our choice. Some of the most common places sisters volunteer are:
      </p>
      <center>
      <b>University Hospitals - Cleveland
      <br /></b><b>Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital
      <br /></b><b>Tutoring at Church of the Covenant
      <br /></b><b>Cleveland Food Bank
      <br /></b><b>Cleveland Animal Protective League
      <br /></b><b>Nature Center at Shake Lakes
      <br /></b><b>American Red Cross Blood Drives
      <br /></b><b>Cleveland Museum of Natural History
      <br /></b><b>Great Lakes Science Center
      </center></b><br />

      <p>
        Our sisters are dedicated to improving the communities in which we live. We have been given much by the people and organizations around us,
        and it is important that we take time to give back. We believe in empowering individuals to stand up against domestic violence, and support
        survivors. We are enthusiastic about our philanthropy and service, and hope to spread our energy to those around us.
      </p>
