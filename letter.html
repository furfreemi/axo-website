    <h2>From Our President</h2>
    <br />
    Greetings! <br /><br />

    Greek Life here at Case Western Reserve University is very unique and there is a sense of camaraderie,
    where we want to see each other succeed. Those same ideals that our community holds, is true within the
    Zeta Upsilon chapter of Alpha Chi Omega here at Case. The sisterhood that has been established on campus
    for over 30 years has stayed strong through the values that we uphold, which are: personal development, character,
    financial responsibility, academic interest, and leadership ability. When combined, these values are what unite
    all 230,000 Alpha Chi's across the nation.  <br /><br />

    We strive to create a balanced experience between academics and the creating a sisterhood. Our chapter is comprised
    of a wide variety of majors which includes, engineers, nursing, biochemistry, and business. We are able use our diversity
    of majors to our advantage and assign academic mentors to younger members to foster relationships and ideal that academics
    are important, to just name an example. Our sisterhood event allows members to try something new, whether it be ice skating
    in the winter or going downtown to watch Wicked together in Play House Square, there is always something fun to try out. We
    also have mixers with other chapters or host social events like Sweaters and Service, where we invite the entire campus to
    participate in community service in December, to develop and strengthen relations with different organizations and chapters on campus.
     <br /><br />

    We are very proud of our philanthropy, Domestic Violence Awareness, in which we dedicate an entire week in October to raise awareness
    and money for the Domestic Violence and Child Advocacy Center of Greater Cleveland (DVCAC). This week long event is created to educate
    our community about domestic violence and the impacts that it can have in our community. Not only are we passionate of our own philanthropy,
    members take an active part in being involve and participate in other philanthropies on campus.  <br /><br />

    Joining the chapter has been an unbelievable experience, one that has really enhanced my college experience. The mentors that I found
    and the lifelong friendships that I've built have been a huge part of my time here. Meeting women in Alpha Chi, that are also heavily
    involved in other organizations on campus has been inspiring and humbling. It has been a privilige serving as chapter president for the
    Zeta Upsilon chapter and I believe that I've made my experience in Alpha Chi Omega truly my own and that everyone is equipped also equipped
    with the power to do so. Please feel free to look around our website to learn more about our chapter.  <br /><br />

    Sincerely,  <br /><br />

    Stephanie Chen <br />
    Former President, ZY Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega
